# vision_cpp
Porting the vision code of my robotics team(FRC 2502) from Python to C++

## Why does this exist?

My robotics team uses vision code I wrote in Python. Unfortunately, it only runs at ~7 FPS.
I am looking into whether or not using vision code in C++ will be faster.

## Dependencies?

To run, install

1. [OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/introduction/table_of_content_introduction/table_of_content_introduction.html#table-of-content-introduction)

1. [Network Tables](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/ntcore)

## How do I compile?

1. Install OpenCV

2. `./compile.sh Vision` when inside the folder

3. `./Vision`
