# vision_cpp
Porting the vision code of my robotics team(FRC 2502) from Python to C++

## Why does this exist?

My robotics team uses vision code I wrote in Python. Unfortunately, it only runs at ~7 FPS. 
I am looking into whether or not using vision code in C++ will be faster.

## How do I compile?

1. Install OpenCV

2. `./compile.sh` when inside the folder

3. Execute the binary that shows up.
